# AutoTestX – A Scalable Selenium + TestNG Framework

AutoTestX is a **plug-and-play, enterprise-grade test automation framework** built with **Java, Selenium, and TestNG**. It enables scalable, maintainable, and high-speed UI testing for web applications across regulated and mission-critical domains.

> 🧪 Designed for CI/CD environments, AutoTestX supports modular architecture, parallel execution, and ExtentReports for dynamic reporting — empowering software teams to deliver **secure, bug-free, and compliant releases**.

---

## Why AutoTestX Matters

In today's fast-paced digital ecosystem, software failures can cause major disruptions — especially in **aviation, banking, and healthcare**. AutoTestX helps mitigate these risks through:

- **Robust and reusable automation components**
- **Early bug detection and faster test cycles**
- **Seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines**
- **Real-time test reporting for compliance and audit readiness**

This aligns with national priorities in **software safety**, **digital infrastructure resilience**, and **AI-assisted QA automation** — as highlighted in OSTP and NIST AI standards.
